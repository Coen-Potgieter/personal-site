        review:
          'on first listen the first thing that hit me was the sheer diversity of the tracks on this album. Although this makes for a fun listening experience, it quicly begins to feel flat. It sounds like a various artists album with a lack of direction. There are no songs on this album that particularly blow me away but they are all firmly "ok". Again, lots of diversity on this thing makes it fun from pretty tough sounding hip hop on NOLA, to some bedroom pop on Geezer featuring Dominic Fike to a steaihgt up dance treack on Girflreind? Overall fun listen but far from something special/ poppy  it sounds exciting',
